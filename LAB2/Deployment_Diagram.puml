CSV --> Notebook : Feeds raw data
Notebook --> Storage : Saves processed data & logs
Notebook --> Model : Trains/Updates model
Model --> Inference : Provides predictions
UI --> Inference : Sends prediction requests
Inference --> Monitor : Logs prediction details
Monitor --> Feedback : Triggers retraining events
Feedback --> Model : Updates model based on new training
UI --> Feedback : (Optional) User feedback for retraining
